# DiabetesPredection
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.2 From the data set in the (.csv) File We can find several variables, some of them are independent (several medical predictor variables) and only one target dependent variable (Outcome).

The Diabetes Prediction project uses machine learning to analyze medical data and predict whether a person is at risk of diabetes. The model is trained on key health indicators such as Glucose level, BMI, Insulin, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, and Diabetes Pedigree Function to make accurate predictions.
